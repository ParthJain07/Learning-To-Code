Solving Neetcode 150
Binary Search
    ->Time Based Key-Value Store
        ->Uses an unordered_map<string, vector<pair<int, string>>> mp to store key-value pairs.
        ->Uses Binary Search to efficiently find the required value.
        ->Check if key exists in mp. If not, return an empty string ("").
        ->Edge Case: If the earliest timestamp for this key is greater than timestamp, return "".
        ->Binary Search on timestamps:
        ->If mid timestamp matches, return the value.
        ->If mid timestamp is less than the given timestamp, update ans and search right.
        ->Otherwise, search left.
        ->Return the last valid value found (ans).
