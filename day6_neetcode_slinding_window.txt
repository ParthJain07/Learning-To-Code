Solving  Neetcode 150
Array, slinding window 
    ->Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
        ->use of slinding window
        ->check freq fo each char and then take the max of res , r-l+1
    ->Longest Repeating Character Replacement
        ->store freq of each
        ->max freq in map
        ->loop ( condition strlen=j-i+1 and subtra largest distinct char that is max freq ) > k
            -> decrement freq of l and increment l 
        -> store maxlen(strlen, maxlen)
